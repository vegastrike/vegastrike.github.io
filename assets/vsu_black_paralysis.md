NOTE: Much of what is said here is adapted from the original VSU: Black-Paralysis website as discovered at [Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/p/black-paralysis/).

## About

VSU: Black-Paralysis was originally developed by Daniel Aleksandrow (dandandaman). The ideas for it started
forming in August 2002. At that stage it had become apparent that Vega Strike was becoming more like Privateer,
and less like Wing Commander in terms of game-play.  Although happy with this, he wanted more.  So he planned
to develop a companion data set to Vega Strike, set in the same universe, but with more of a Wing Commander feel to
it. What is now in development is based on the third iteration of Daniel's work that was hosted at [Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/p/black-paralysis/).

### Background from Daniel Aleksandrow

The first title, for those interested, was thought up the day of the decision to create the mod, not written down,
and forgotten the day after.  It was, as far as I can recall, the perfect name.  However, over the next week I was
completely unable to recall it.  Hence, with the need to name the folder containing my working data, I came up with
Black-Paralysis.

For a variety of reasons, not the least of which is my inbuilt skill for putting off large projects, nothing much
has happened since.  Only recently has my interest been rekindled to a significant extent.  Hopefully, from here on
out, development might actually move forwards.

Set about 50 years after the events in the standard Vegastrike universe, the core of the game will revolve around a
set of systems used by the Confederation for various types of high level research and development.  Isolated from the
core of the jump network, an Aeran exploration party drops, undetected, out of SPEC.  With isolation the main line of
defence, what little security exists within these systems is overwhelmed by the alien force, and much in the way of
research, personnel and facilities is lost before reinforcements, in the form of a scheduled SPEC convoy, arrive.

The player will be dropped into the middle of that, when the Aera first arrive.  What happens next isn't quite a matter
of "I don't want to spoil it", but rather, "I haven't decided".

At the moment this is a one man effort and development is rather slow, if you think this sounds cool and want to start
helping (experience with Vegastrike would be a bonus, but not necessary), then drop me, dandandaman, an email
(address available from the sourceforge project page).

### Thanks and Recognition

Much thanks is due to Daniel Aleksandrow for what was built and we'd like to continue honoring him through
the ressurection of VSU: Black-Paralysis and its inclusion in our formally supported game assets.

## Continuing the Vision

When we found VSU: Black-Paralysis it had been idle for many years. As with many things in the Vega Strike projects
it had fallen dormant. Reading through Daniel's information the game seemed to fit with some of the goals of the
development team to have some small game assets that were more limited. Our hope is to update the game to use
the latest game engine and be able to restore it to what it was prior; then perhaps iterate some to continue
providing a basic game that others can learn from and utilize as was the vision set out for VSU: Black-Paralysis.

You can find the current supported code at [VSU: Black-Paralysis on GitHub](https://github.com/vegastrike/vsu-black-paralysis/),
alongside the other Vega Strike development work.
