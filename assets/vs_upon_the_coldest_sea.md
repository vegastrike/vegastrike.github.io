## About

VS: Upon the Coldest Sea was originally developed by Daniel Horn and joined by many others to create
a space simulation game in the style of [Elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)), and
[Chris Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Roberts_(video_game_developer))' [Wing Commander Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Commander_(video_game)). The VS Developers created their own storyline which became
Vega Strike: Upon the Coldest Sea.

The Vega Strike Engine was started in 2001 by the Daniel Horn and originally hosted at Source Forge.
After many years of development life happened and the team departed. In 2019 a new team of developers
stepped up to continue the efforts and ressurrect the games and the revolutionary space simulation
engine that drove them.
