## About

The Vega Strike Engine supported a number of different game assets. One of its earliest game assets
was related to the [Privateer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Commander:_Privateer)/[Wing Commander Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Commander_(video_game)). A variety of spin offs were created based
on these assets.

[Rune Morling](https://github.com/ermo) picked up the PWCU Assets in an effort to ressurect the game
play. [Benjamen Meyer](https://github.com/benjamenmeyer/) sought to join him in the effort and found
the underlying game engine (Vega Strike) to be in need of updating as well; as a result PWCU has joined
the list of officially supported game assets by the current Vega Strike Development Team.
