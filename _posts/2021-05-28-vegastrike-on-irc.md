Vega Strike is moving to Libera.chat for our primary IRC communications.
<!--more-->

We have been monitoring the situation with the [FreeNode][freenode], and after seeing some of the
antics that [FreeNode][freenode] has pulled this last week or so and with a general consensus for
the few of us ever present in the IRC we have moved our primary IRC channel over to
[Libera.chat][libera].

## What about the FreeNode Channel?

We haven't been directly impacted yet, but several of on IRC are no longer comfortable
with a wait and see approach as we have been taking while watching things unfold with
other major open source projects that are more present on IRC than we have been.

That said, we have historically run with two IRC provides - a primary and a backup.
However, our backup provider (irc.stealth.net) seems to no longer be around so at least
for the foreseeable future we will maintain our [FreeNode][freenode] IRC channel as backup to our
new home on Libera.chat.

## How to get on libera.chat?

[Libera.chat][libera] provides some excellent help on their website for registering a [Nickname][liberanick],
and also for connecting using various [clients][liberaclients]. Please use their [Guides][liberaguides] to
get started.

## Why libera.chat?

After a number of events at [FreeNode][freenode] quite a few of the staff and operators left [FreeNode][freenode].
A great many of them joined together and created libera.chat with a goal of serving
the open source community.

## Where on libera.chat?

We have registered the #vegastrike and #vegastrike-\* channels for our use with [Libera.chat][libera].

We will use #vegastrike for general communications and are looking to enable our community
to use the #vegastrike-\* channels for focused discussions, e.g #vegastrike-pwcu. If you're
interested in these community channels then please reach out.

## Why keep around IRC when there's more modern chats system available?

We have quite a diverse community coming from all stretches of life. Some folks still prefer
the [Forums][vs-forum], while others prefer IRC or [Gitter.im][gitter]. We want to enable
our community to use the communications methods that they are most comfortable with so long
as it's not a burden for us all. We may even look at other solutions like [Matrix.org][matrix]
which may help us bring these together into more coherent view to help administer them.

## Want to help out?

We are certainly in need of volunteers to help run our various communications infrastructure.
If you're willing to help out, then please reach out to us either in our [Gitter][gitter]
channel, IRC, or even fail [e-mail][social].

If you'd like to be an IRC operator then please reach out.
