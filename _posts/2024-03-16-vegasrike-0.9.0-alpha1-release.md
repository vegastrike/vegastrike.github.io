It is with great pleasure that the Vega Strike Development Team announces the release of Vega Strike 0.9.0-alpha2 and VS:Upon The Coldest Sea 0.9.0-alpha1.
<!--more-->

Join our protagonist Deucalion in adventures around the universe as a bounty hunter, mercenary, or merchant flying through the
stars. Meet the deadly Aera and mysterious Rlaan. Battle with the Confederation. Run alongside Pirates. Or just buy and sell as a merchant while you
explore. The universe and adventure are yours.

## What's changed?

Since our last release in March 2022 of Vega Strike 0.8.0 we've continued to refactor the code, improve it, and worked towards bringing back official
support for more platforms.

We now only support Python3 builds. Python2 support is slowly being removed and should no longer be utilized as Python2 is no longer supported by
its own community.

The 0.9.0 release increases the Engine API to Version 2. This means there may be some incompatibilities for game assets. Please ensure
that the game assets and Vega Strike Engine match. We do not have a specific change log of the Engine API at this time; assistance during
our alpha and beta releases with building it would be greatly appreciated.

With 0.9.x we are officially supporting both Mac and Windows platforms. This means that we are ready to provide pre-built
binaries as part of our build pipelines.

NOTE: Under Windows the Vega Strike Settings utility is currently broken due to a dependency being flagged by Windows improperly and
therefore preventing the utility from being able to run. Fixing this will be a priority for releasing 0.9.x.

For a complete list of differences see [Vega Strike Engine Delta][vsedelta] and [Vega Strike: Upon the Coldest Sea Delta][vsutcsdelta].

## Want to help out?

There's a lot to do. We're working diligently to update Vega Strike. This is just an alpha release to start getting community feedback.
Please try it and let us know about bugs you find. We'd also greatly appreciate any help in fixing the bugs.

Version 0.10.0 is our next step along the line.  We've already got several releases planned in the process of continuing to update our dependencies and fix bugs;
you can see our [Road Map][roadmap]. We need everything from coding, story development, art work, documentation, and even just generally helping the community.

The development team is active at [Gitter.im][gitter] and we'd love to hear from you.

You can also find the community at the [Vega Strike Forums][forums].

### Why Vega Strike Engine 0.9.0-alpha2?

What happened to 0.9.0-alpha1 for the engine? A mishap during the release process meant that 0.9.0-alpha1 was cut against the wrong
branch (master, aka 0.10.x) so it was removed. 0.9.0-alpha2 is what was meant to be 0.9.0-alpha1.
